I am a Chartered (in the UK) and Licensed (in the USA) Mechanical Engineer with over 22 years of global experience across Oil & Gas, LNG, Refinery, and Energy sectors. 
Now, I am transitioning into the exciting world of Python development, with a strong focus on automation, scripting, and data handling.

Currently, I am:
- Completing 'Complete Python Bootcamp' (Udemy) by Jose Portilla
- Building 100+ Python projects with '100 Days of Code' by Dr. Angela Yu
- Planning to complete 'Python for Everybody' by the University of Michigan (Coursera)

My goal is to apply Python skills in real-world scenarios, solving problems in automation, data processing, and reporting, while gradually expanding into AI/ML.

I am open to:
- Part-time or freelance Python scripting/automation/data projects
- Collaborations on real-world solutions
- Opportunities to grow in AI/ML development

Tech Skills: Python, Pandas, NumPy, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Tkinter, API Integration, VS Code
